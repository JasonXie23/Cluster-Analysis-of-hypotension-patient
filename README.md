## Assignment
This project focuses on analyzing patient data related to hypotension. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis, apply clustering methods, and identify distinguishing features among different clusters using KMeans.

## Problem Description
The objective of this project is to process and analyze a dataset containing information about hypotension patients. The dataset includes patient demographics, clinical scores, length of stay, and other relevant metrics. The KMeans clustering technique is applied to identify patterns or groupings of patients that share similar characteristics.

### Key Tasks:
1.Load and preprocess the patient dataset.

2.Perform exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics, boxplots, and distribution plots.

3.Apply KMeans clustering and determine the optimal number of clusters (k).

4.Visualize the clusters and draw insights from the analysis.

## How to Set Up the Environment

To run this notebook, you will need to install the following dependencies. These can be installed using the requirements.txt file.

However, the recommended method is to run the notebook on Google Colab, as the environment used in the original notebook was set up in Colab. The requirements.txt file generated from Colab tends to include many dependencies, which may not be ideal for local setups. Running the notebook on Google Colab allows for a smoother experience.

### Instructions for Google Colab to run this notebook:
1.Mount your Google Drive in Colab to access the dataset.

2.Make sure to adjust the file path in the code to point to the location of your hypotension_patient.csv file within your Google Drive.

### Required Packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
